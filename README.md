# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

## About the Challenge

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered "unsinkable" RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren't enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

## Challenge Objective

In this challenge, we need to build a predictive model that answers the question: "what sorts of people were more likely to survive?" using passenger data (name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.).

## Data Used in the Competition

In this competition, we have access to two similar datasets that include passenger information:

1. **train.csv**: contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, reveals whether they survived or not, also known as the "ground truth".
2. **test.csv**: contains similar information but does not disclose whether the 418 other passengers survived.

Our task is to predict these outcomes using models we develop from the training data.
